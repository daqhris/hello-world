# hello-world

## Amahoro! (*Greetings in Kirundi, "Peace!"*)

Followed instructions can be found here https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

This winter is wrecking my bones and brains. Therefore, I am cheerfully answering a hotline bling call to pick up on the fingers-and-nerves break dance!
