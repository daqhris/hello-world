# hello-world

## Amahoro! (*Greetings in Kirundi, "Peace!"*)

This is my "Hello World" project. 
It consists of the results of my first GitHub tutorial.  
I am officially taking baby steps into a new community. 

The tutorial can be found here https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

This winter is destroying my bones and my brain.  
So I am cheerfully answering a Hotline Bling call to pick up the fingers-and-nerves breakdance!
