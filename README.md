# hello-world

Amahoro!

This is my Hello World project. It is a made of results of my first GitHub tutorial. I am officially taking my baby steps into a new community. Followed instructions can be found here https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

This winter is wrecking my bones and brains. Therefore, I am cheerfully answering a hotline bling call to pick up on the fingers and nerves break dance! (just don't wanna miss my college grad bus :D)
